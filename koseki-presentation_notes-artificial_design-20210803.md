## Introduction

I am so happy to see so many faces event if virtually. Of course, like many of you, I was hoping for this presentation to take place in person.

By ignoring artificial intelligence’s implications on their practice, designers run the risk of becoming something of the past. On the one hand, AI provides an opportunity to improve human and non-human habitats through design. When used for good, AI can help designers face contemporary social challenges like no other technology before. On the other hand, algorithmic biases can have detrimental effects on single individuals, as well as on society, if they are not recognized but implemented. Designers thus have a huge responsibility towards the public when it comes to integrating AI technology into their practice. Yet, many design schools remain reluctant to engage with AI’s mastery and ethical know-how. As a practice that needs to continuously evolve with its time, design has no choice but to invest in AI if it wants to invest in designers. Only then can AI empower design and designers and provide a powerful tool to formalize their ethical and aesthetic innovation for future generations.

Everything in our environment is artificial. The building you are sitting in, the furniture you are sitting at, the computer you are using, and if you look outside your window right now, everything you see is pretty much artificial as well. The garden next door, the trees along the street, the park across the lane or the fields on the other side of town, and even the lake you sometime go to in the summer, which looks natural to you, results from a carefully crafted design and governance process. We have made these buildings, streets, towns and landscape parts of our cultural heritage. And each one of us document those with pictures and records, adding to billions of terabytes of digitally preserved cultural artefacts of the past and present for future generations.

In the last decade, our capacity to create meaningful knowledge from massive amounts of data with Artificial Intelligence has transformed natural and social sciences. But the integration of AI technology to the design process has been much slower. Current research architecture, landscape and urban planning show little evidence of AI’s increasing importance and reach. And yet the application of AI to our environment is occurring across Tech giants, construction, and the real estate industry. What if architecture and urban design becomes the exclusive domain of engineers and computer scientists. Or imagine a world where opaque AI algorithms empower a cast of real estate developers solely concerned with optimizing their investments. To me, neither scenarios contribute to design’s primary goal, which is to formalize our ethical and aesthetic ideals.

In a series of project we develop at the UNESCO Chair in Urban Landscape at the University of Montréal, we ask what value might an AI-empowered design process—based on inclusivity, sustainability and social justice—offer society? Would it enhance the quality of our built and natural environment? What obstacles prevent the emergence of an AI-empowered design?


[SLIDE ]

To date, computer-aided design has relied mainly on small sets of pre-defined parametric data. Yet new technologies, such as natural language processing, image recognition and multimodal processing offer a much broader understanding of our environment: a moment-by-moment picture of humanity’s cultural production over extended periods of time, providing information about both the content and the structure of our cultural evolution. For example, a designer could generate a new chair design based on data about millions of models that already exist. This way, choices about the aesthetic quality of objects could be addressed: should we focus on form or materiality? What texture produces the most striking visual effect on people? What shape better in a given context? Design integration could be defined by crossing multiple types of information about objects and their social and material contexts. Similar digital processes could generate meaningful user interactions, shapes, colors, materiality, lighting, and other components of the design project. An AI driven design could thus produce innovative outcomes for objects, buildings, public squares and other components of the built environment.

In that framework, what do you think an overall design strategy for a city would look like? and how to make it evolve over time? We know that archives hold many descriptions of cities from a variety of sources extending over multiple centuries, and paintings and drawings collect representations of past and ideal landscapes. How can we use this material feed a comprehensive picture of society-level worldview? In what ways can we build on those images to design urban and natural environments today? How can we use indoor scenes and portraits of the same periods to thicken the quality of such images. What can we use allegories and bodily gestures to depict past understanding of urban aesthetics. In other words, we want to know how have concepts of good and beautiful evolved through time and space?


[SLIDE ]

Textual archives offer a totally different channel for generating AI-empowered design. Consider, for example, all the material that describes—with acute precision—the evolution of historical urban landscapes, as well as the monuments of the past. Can we make the readings of their virtual presence tangible for future generations? Oral histories also, which capture a valuable record of marginalized worldviews. Don’t they offer an opportunity for integrating the experience of minorities into design? Similarly, how can we use audio recordings of music to enrich design projects with emotional charges and urgency?


[SLIDE ]

By answering these questions, we want AI-empowered design to leverage the capacity to create new high-quality cultural artefacts. There is of course significant barriers to this endeavour. Design methods as we know them were conceived without access to terabytes of data. For example existing architectural masterpieces, have been designed mostly on an iterative process, and are typically inspired by a maximum of a dozen case studies. How can we do the same using massively longitudinal data sets of millions of buildings, including materiality, lighting and structure? The point is that vast and emerging data sets on cultural artefacts offer new qualitative perspectives on urban space, but our current paradigms might not prove responsive.

There also remain enormous institutional obstacles to advancing an artificial design. In terms of approach, two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations generate different challenges to conception and production. Ideally, design must provide an enjoyable experience or at least resonate with people. As for infrastructure, the leap from handmade design and CAD to an AI-empowered approach is bigger than a linear regression to machine learning, largely due to our lack of understanding of the so-called “design process.” There are usually fewer financial resources available to design schools, which require more investment per student and produce less standardized research, and—until the pandemic—public space and parks rarely constituted a top priority of city governments.

Maybe the most difficult challenge for an AI empowered design resides in data, specifically with respect to representation and inclusion. Much of the environmental design to date has been produced by members of culturally dominant groups: AKA White-Cis-Men. The same goes with the cultural artefacts that most societies valorize and preserve. To date, digitized work made by women, cultural minorities and people with differently abled bodies remains marginal. To avoid the perpetuation of spatial inequalities, robust monitoring of diversity and inclusion in digital cultural data is needed to safeguard accessibility and usability by all. Evidently, this also concerns all people involved in creating AI-centered design tools. As recent debates over the representation and inclusion of AI highlights, the production of inequalities tends to add up in complex data processing pipeline without acute scrutiny and structural diversity.

Exclusion and inequalities within design can have large scale and lasting detrimental effects on many populations. A transdisciplinary enforced set of procedures, technologies, and rules are needed to reduce these risks while preserving design innovation. As a cornerstone of such a transdisciplinary initiative, design schools must increase their technical knowledge to understand the potential for algorithmic bias and misrepresentation; these new approaches do not fit their current paradigm for inclusion. Many remain unprepared to consider that complete data sets could generate detrimental design. Further, it would be beneficial for these schools to oversee the creation of a secure and centralized data infrastructure. Currently, existing digitized cultural artefact data sets are scattered among many institutions with uneven skills and understanding and widely varying data management standards. Designers themselves must develop technology that accounts for diversity and inclusion while curating data that is essential for research. These systems, in turn, may prove useful for industry and policymakers in assessing diversity and inclusion in public spaces.

Finally, the emergence of an AI-empowered design shares the need to develop a paradigm for digital empowerment of designers and scholars with other nascent transdisciplinary fields. Design schools need to understand and reward the effort associated with honing high level digital capabilities. For the moment, AI-empowered design needs to come up from teams of designers, social and computer scientists. In the future, the question will be whether design schools should focus on AI, or if computer science departments will train designers. In any case, the emergence of AI offers a powerful model for the development of human knowledge. AI has involved fields ranging from social science to the arts to computer science. It has attracted the investment of substantial resources to create a common endeavor, and created enormous financial and intellectual resources in the last decade. AI-empowered design holds the same potential and demands matching investments.
