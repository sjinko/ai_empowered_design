# How AI Can Empower the Design Process

**Draft version — Do not cite — Do not share**

We live in an artificial world. The house we live in, the furniture we sit on, the bus we take, the phone we call with, the park we play at. We plant fields to feed us, and maintain so-called natural reserves to sustain wildlife. We make buildings, streets, towns and landscape parts of our cultural heritage. Each one of us document the places and scenery they like, adding to billions of terabytes that digitally preserve cultural artefacts of the past and present for future generations (Kaplan and di Lenardo 2017).

The capacity to create meaningful knowledge from massive amounts of data with Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed fields such as natural and social sciences (Falk 2019, Edelman et al. 2020, Robila and Robila 2020). But the integration of AI technology to the design process has been much slower (Chaillou 2019, O’Donnell 2018). Leading journals in architecture, landscape and urban planning shows little evidence of this field. But the application of AI to environmental design is occurring across CAD giants, construction and the real estate industry. With AI, architecture and urban design could become the exclusive domain of engineers and computer scientists. Alternatively, there might emerge a privileged set of urban development moguls presiding over opaque algorithms conceived to optimize investments. Neither scenarios will contribute to design’s primary goals to formalize ethical and aesthetic innovation for humanity.

What value might AI-empowered design process—based on inclusivity, sustainability and social justice—offer society, by enhancing the quality of our built and natural environment? What obstacles prevent the emergence of an AI-empowered design?

To date, computer-aided design has relied mainly on small sets of self-defined parametric data. New technologies, such as natural language processing, image recognition and multimodal processing offer a moment-by-moment picture of cultural production over extended periods of time, providing information about both the content and the structure of cultural evolution. For example, color patterns could be designed based on paintings data, and choices about the aesthetic quality of objects could be addressed: should we focus on form or materiality of objects? What shape better fits a given context? What composition produces the most striking visual effect on people? Design integration could be defined over time with generative design pipelines. Such digital infrastructure could define meaningful integration, shapes, colors, materiality, lighting, and other components of the design project. The data could produce interesting outcomes for objects, buildings, images and interactive platforms.

We can also define what an overall design strategy for a city would look like, and how to make it evolve over time. Archives have records of atmospherical descriptions from a variety of sources extending over multiple centuries, and paintings and drawings collect picturesque visions of past landscapes. How does this material feed a comprehensive picture of society-level imaginaries? In what ways can we build on those images to design urban and rural landscapes? Indoor scenes and portraits of the same periods thicken the quality of such imaginaries. Allegories and bodily gestures depict past understanding of urban aesthetics. Such data may provide useful epistemological insights: How concepts of good and beautiful evolved through time and space?

Textual archives offer a totally different channel for generating AI-empowered design. Consider, for example, all the material that describes—with acute precision—the evolution of historical urban landscapes, as well as the monuments of the past, where the concerns for their virtual presence can become visible for future generations. Oral histories, which by their nature capture a valuable record of marginalized worldviews, offer ample opportunity for design—integrating the experience of minorities into urban built and unbuilt forms. Similarly, audio recordings of music offer a unique chance to enrich design projects with emotional charges and urgency. 

In short, an AI-empowered design that leverages the capacity to create new cultural artefacts with an unprecedented pace and quality is arising. Significant barriers, nevertheless, might curb this development. Existing ways of design were conceived without access to terabytes of data defining step by step evolution from past work (Goodhouse 2017). For example, what do existing architectural masterpieces, built mostly on an iterative design process, typically inspired by a few dozen case studies, tell us about massively longitudinal data sets of millions of buildings, including materiality, lighting and structure? These vast, emerging data sets on cultural artefacts surely offer qualitatively new perspectives on urban space, but our current paradigms might not prove responsive.

There also remain enormous institutional obstacles to advancing an artificial design. In terms of approach, two-dimensional and three-dimensional representations present different challenges to conceive and produce. Design must provide an enjoyable experience or at least resonate with people. As for infrastructure, the leap from handmade design and CAD to an AI-empowered approach stands bigger than from linear regression to machine learning largely due to our lack of understanding of the so-called “design process.” There is less research and fewer financial resources available in the design schools, and public space and parks rarely constitute a top priority of city governments.

Maybe the most difficult challenge resides in the data, with respect to representation and inclusion. Much of the environmental design to date has been produced by males of culturally dominant groups. The same goes with cultural artefacts valorized and thus preserved. To date, digitized work conceived by women, cultural minorities and people with differently able bodies remain marginal. To avoid the perpetuation of spatial inequalities, robust monitoring of diversity and inclusion in digital cultural data is needed to safeguard accessibility and usability by all. Evidently, this also concerns all people involved in creating AI-centered design tools. As recent debates over the representation and inclusion of AI highlights (Gibney 2020), the production of inequalities tends to add up in complex data processing pipeline without acute scrutiny and structural diversity (Crawford et al. 2019). 

Because shaping exclusion and inequalities into design can have large scale and lasting detrimental effects on large share of the population (Jacobs 1961), a transdisciplinary enforced set of procedures, technologies, and rules are needed that reduces this risk but preserves design innovation. As a cornerstone of such a transdisciplinary initiative, design schools must increase their technical knowledge to understand the potential for algorithmic bias and misrepresentation because these new approaches do not fit their current paradigm for inclusion. Many remain unprepared to consider that complete data sets could generate detrimental design. Further, it would be beneficial for these schools to oversee the creation of a secure and centralized data infrastructure. Currently, existing digitized cultural artefacts data sets are scattered among many institutions with uneven skills and understanding and widely varying data management standards. Designers themselves must develop technology that accounts for diversity and inclusion while curating to the data essential for research. These systems, in turn, may prove useful for industry and policymakers in assessing diversity and inclusion of public space.

Finally, the emergence of an AI-empowered design share with other nascent transdisciplinary fields (e.g., digital humanities) the need to develop a paradigm for digital empowerment of designers and scholars. Design schools need to understand and reward the effort of honing high level digital capabilities. For the moment, AI-empowered design needs to come up from teams of designers, social and computer scientists. In the future, the question will be whether design schools should teach AI, or computer science department nurture designers. The emergence of an artificial intelligence offers a powerful model for the development of human knowledge. AI has involved fields ranging from social science to the arts to computer science. It has attracted the investment of substantial resources to create a common endeavor, and created enormous financial and intellectual resources in the last decade (ITU 2018). I would argue that AI-empowered design holds the same potential, and demands matching investments.
